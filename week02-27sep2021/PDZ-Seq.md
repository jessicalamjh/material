## Technology
PDZ-Seq is a method to identify protein-protein interactions. It uses phage display to determine binding various PDZ domains to peptides, binding is verified by ELISA and the DNA of the binding phages is sequenced.

## Application
This technology can be used to narrow down specific protein regions required for binding by seeing how differences in the DNA sequence affect the protein binding.

## Statistics
One method of determining specificity of a particular ligand region is to use the Z-score.
