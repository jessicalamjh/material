# Native Elongating Transcript Sequencing (NET-seq)

## Introduction

* Unlike other RNA sequencing methods relying on either RNAP-DNA crosslink or nuclei isolation and reinitiation, the Native Elongating Transcript Sequencing (NET-seq) provides an intuitive and highly accurate RNA sequencing solution at nucleotide resolution. 

* NET-seq captures the 3' end of nascent and actively transcribed RNAPII RNAs and extracts them via RNAPII immunoprecipitation, followed by reverse trancription and deep seqeucing on the RNA as shown in the figure below.

* This technique, due to its nature of direct obersvation of the nascent transcript, can be applied to quantify the transcription, observe the trancription of unstable RNA, detect promotor directionality and quantify the RNAPII pause during transcription.
