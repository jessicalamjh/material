# ATAC-Seq

### Method

ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) is a technique used in molecular biology to assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility as chromatin state, chromatin compaction, nucleosome positioning. It is done by inserting tagged double stranded DNA fragments via a hyperactiv transposase (Tn5 transposase) that preferentially operates on open regions of the genome. The tagged DNA can later be purified, amplified and sequenced which allows to determine which regions of the DNA are of increased accessibility.
