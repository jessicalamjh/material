RNA Sequencing is a recently developed approach to transcriptome profiling that uses deep-sequencing technologies. It provides precise measurements of levels of transcripts and their isoforms and determines the cDNA sequences. It is used for mapping and quantifying transcriptome.

- Technology: RNA Sequencing
- Application: Gene expression
- Statistics: Negative binomial (refer to table below for other examples)
