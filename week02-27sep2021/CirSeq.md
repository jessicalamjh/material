# CirSeq

# Method description

CirSeq is a new HTS technique of RNA virus populations. The technique revolves around circularisation of fragmented viral RNAs. Upon sequencing these circularised fragments, a consensus sequence of the initial RNA template is derived. 

# Technology 

High-Throughput Sequencing (CirSeq)

# Application 

- Studying the genetic changes underlying the evolution of virus populations.
- Define the mutation rates of poliovirus and uncover the mutation landscape of the population

# Statistics 

The statistical significance of mutations detected was determined by a one-sided **binomial** test in R using the average estimated error probability at each genome position as the null probability of success.
